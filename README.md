### Y is a Twitter (X) Clone built using:
- Next.js (TypeScript)
- NextAuth (Email Credentials & Google OAuth)
- Redux Toolkit
- MongoDB
- Tailwind CSS

Data architecture is heavily referenced from the MongoDB Team's [Socialite](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/socialite/tree/master). The application uses the "fan out on write" approach when making changes that would be seen by many users, eg: posting a tweet and having it reflect in your followers' timelines.

Any changes that involve more than one user's timeline are handled by MongoDB Atlas' Triggers, which run on a serverless compute layer. 

#### This includes things like:
- Creating/deleting tweets
- Replying to tweets
- Retweeting
- Liking
